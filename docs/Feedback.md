## Positives
You bullet points are very concise and make a lot of sense; they definitely make your work experience sound like high level experience. 

The verbs you use in your resume are very direct and action-oriented. 

It's easy to tell when you started and completed each position. 

## Improvements
Update your bullet points for **BYU-Idaho Student Employment** (it looks like you have the original bullet points in there).  

I'd add some bullet points to your volunteer experience. These could be something like:
- Coordinated Sunday meetings for a local church
- Supervised 15 local volunteers

I'd also change "missionary" to "full-time volunteer". Tends to have more positive vibes with people who don't like Christianity as much.
